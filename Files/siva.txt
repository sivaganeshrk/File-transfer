The words hadn't flowed from his fingers for the past few weeks. 
He never imagined he'd find himself with writer's block, 
but here he sat with a blank screen in front of him. 
That blank screen taunting him day after day had started to play with his mind. 
He didn't understand why he couldn't even type a single word, just one to begin the process and build from there. 
And yet, he already knew that the eight hours he was prepared to sit in front of his computer today would end 
with the screen remaining blank.

It was difficult to explain to them how the diagnosis of certain death had
 actually given him life. While everyone around him was in tears and upset, he actually felt more at ease. 
 The doctor said it would be less than a year. That gave him a year to live, something he'd failed
  to do with his daily drudgery of a routine that had passed as life until then.
